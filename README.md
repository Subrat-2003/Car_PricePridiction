# Car_PricePridiction:
Focuses on predicting car purchase price based on customer demographics and financial data (like age, annual salary, credit card debt, net worth). It uses models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, Gradient Boosting, KNN, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost for this prediction task.

**Task Objectives**
